# GHCP Lab Builder

A CLI tool for automating the creation and management of GitHub Copilot (GHCP) lab environments, provisioning organizations, cloning template repositories, and managing lab lifecycles across GitHub Enterprise. Based on [ghas-lab-builder](https://github.com/ghas-lab-automation/ghas-lab-builder), this tool helps instructors and facilitators quickly provision multiple organizations with pre-configured repositories for hands-on training sessions.

## Features

- **Automated Lab Environment Provisioning**: Create complete lab environments with organizations and repositories for multiple users
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently provision resources using concurrent workers (up to 9 parallel operations)
- **GitHub App Integration**: Install GitHub Apps automatically on newly created organizations
- **Template Repository Support**: Clone from template repositories with optional branch inclusion
- **User Validation**: Validate GitHub usernames before provisioning
- **Facilitator Support**: Separate handling for lab facilitators with their own organizations
- **Granular Control**: Manage individual organizations and repositories independently
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports of lab creation and deletion operations
- **Flexible Authentication**: Support for both Personal Access Tokens (PAT) and GitHub App authentication
- **Enterprise Support**: Works with GitHub Enterprise Cloud and Server

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.25.2 or higher
- GitHub Enterprise account
- One of the following authentication methods:
  - Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions
  - GitHub App credentials (App ID and Private Key)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sekar3s/ghcp-lab-builder.git
cd ghcp-lab-builder

# Build the binary
go build -o ghcp-lab-builder

# Or install directly
go install
```

## Authentication

The tool supports two authentication methods:

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

```bash
--token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**Important:** The PAT must be owned by one of the facilitators. During the lab creation process, the PAT owner (facilitator) will be added as an organization owner, which is required to create repositories in the organizations.

**Required Scopes:**

The classic PAT token must have the following scopes:
- `repo`
- `admin:org`
- `admin:enterprise`

**Note:** GitHub rate limits restrict PAT users to 50 repos per minute and 150 repos per hour. 

---

### GitHub App

```bash
--app-id YOUR_APP_ID --private-key "$(cat /path/to/private-key.pem)"
```

**Required Permissions:**

The GitHub App must have the following permissions:

- Repository permissions: 
  - Administration (Read and write)
  - Contents (Read and write)
  - Metadata (Read-only)
- Organization permissions: 
  - Administration (Read and write)
  - Members (Read and write)
- Enterprise permissions: 
  - Enterprise organization installations (Read and write)
  - Enterprise organizations (Read and write)

**Note:** Generate a private key and install the GitHub App on the Enterprise level before using it to create/delete lab
---

**Important:** You must use either `--token` OR both `--app-id` and `--private-key`, but not both simultaneously.

## Usage

### Lab Commands

Lab commands provide end-to-end management of complete lab environments, including organizations and repositories for all users.

#### Create a Lab Environment

Create a complete lab environment with organizations and repositories for all users:

```bash
ghcp-lab-builder lab create \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --lab-date 2025-11-07 \
  --users-file users.txt \
  --facilitators admin1,admin2 \
  --template-repos default/repos.json
```

**What this does:**
- Validates all student and facilitator usernames
- Creates organizations for each user (format: `ghcp-labs-2025-11-07-username`)
- Installs the GitHub App on each organization
- Creates all template repositories in each organization
- Generates a comprehensive report

#### Delete a Lab Environment

Remove all organizations and resources created for a lab:

```bash
ghcp-lab-builder lab delete \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --lab-date 2025-11-07 \
  --users-file users.txt \
  --facilitators admin1,admin2
```

**What this does:**
- Deletes all organizations created for the specified lab date
- Processes deletions in parallel for efficiency
- Generates a deletion report with success/failure details

### Organization Commands

Organization commands allow you to manage individual organizations independently.

#### Create a Single Organization

Create an organization for a specific user:

```bash
ghcp-lab-builder orgs create \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --lab-date 2025-11-07 \
  --user student1 \
  --facilitators admin1,admin2
```

**What this does:**
- Validates the user and facilitators
- Creates organization named `ghcp-labs-2025-11-07-student1`
- Installs the GitHub App on the organization
- Adds facilitators as organization owners
- Does NOT create any repositories (use `repo create` for that)

#### Delete a Single Organization

Delete a specific organization:

```bash
ghcp-lab-builder orgs delete \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --lab-date 2025-11-07 \
  --user student1
```

**What this does:**
- Deletes the organization `ghcp-labs-2025-11-07-student1`
- Removes all repositories and resources within the organization

### Repository Commands

Repository commands allow you to manage repositories within an existing organization.

#### Create Repositories in an Organization

Create repositories from templates in a specific organization:

```bash
ghcp-lab-builder repo create \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --org ghcp-labs-2025-11-07-student1 \
  --repos default/repos.json
```

**What this does:**
- Creates all repositories defined in the JSON file
- Clones from template repositories
- Optionally includes all branches based on configuration

#### Delete Repositories from an Organization

Delete specific repositories from an organization:

```bash
# Delete specific repositories
ghcp-lab-builder repo delete \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --org ghcp-labs-2025-11-07-student1 \
  --repos default/repos.json

# Delete ALL repositories in the organization
ghcp-lab-builder repo delete \
  --enterprise-slug YOUR_ENTERPRISE \
  --token YOUR_TOKEN \
  --org ghcp-labs-2025-11-07-student1
```

**What this does:**
- If `--repos` is specified: Deletes only the repositories listed in the JSON file
- If `--repos` is omitted: Deletes ALL repositories in the organization

```

### Template Repositories File (`repos.json`)

JSON file defining template repositories to clone:

```json
{
  "lab-env-setup": {
    "repos": [
      {
        "template": "org-name/repo-name",
        "include_all_branches": false
      },
      {
        "template": "org-name/another-repo",
        "include_all_branches": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
- `template`: Full repository path in format `owner/repo-name`
- `include_all_branches`: Whether to clone all branches (true) or only the default branch (false)

## Use Cases

### Complete Lab Setup
Use `lab create` when you need to set up a full lab environment for multiple students from scratch.

### Individual Student Setup
Use `orgs create` + `repo create` when you need to provision resources for a single student who joined late or needs a replacement environment.

### Partial Repository Reset
Use `repo delete` + `repo create` when you need to reset specific repositories without affecting the entire organization.

### Organization Management
Use `orgs delete` when you need to remove a specific student's organization without affecting others in the same lab.

## How It Works

### Lab Creation Process

1. **User Validation**: Validates all student and facilitator GitHub usernames
2. **Organization Creation**: Creates organizations named `ghcp-labs-{lab-date}-{username}` (or custom prefix via `--org-prefix`)
3. **GitHub App Installation**: Installs the configured GitHub App on each organization
4. **Repository Provisioning**: Creates repositories from templates in each organization
5. **Report Generation**: Creates detailed markdown and JSON reports in the `reports/` directory

### Lab Deletion Process

1. **Organization Deletion**: Removes all organizations created for the specified lab date
2. **Parallel Processing**: Uses multiple workers for efficient deletion
3. **Report Generation**: Creates deletion reports with success/failure details

### Organization Naming Convention

Organizations are created with the following naming pattern:
```
ghcp-labs-{lab-date}-{username}
```

Example: `ghcp-labs-2025-11-07-student1`

The prefix can be customized using the `--org-prefix` flag (e.g., `--org-prefix my-org`).

## Reports

The tool generates detailed reports in the `reports/` directory:

- **Lab Creation Report**: `lab-report-{lab-date}-{timestamp}.md`
- **Lab Deletion Report**: `lab-delete-report-{lab-date}-{timestamp}.md`

Reports include:
- Total user count
- Success/failure counts
- Individual organization details
- Repository creation status
- Error messages for failures
- Invalid usernames

## Logging

Logs are automatically generated and stored with timestamps:
- Format: `ghcp-lab-builder-{timestamp}.log`
- Level: Info (includes errors and warnings)
- Output: Both file and console

```

## Performance

- **Concurrent Workers**: Up to 9 parallel workers for provisioning/deletion
- **Efficient Processing**: Automatically scales workers based on user count
- **User Validation**: Pre-validates all usernames to avoid failures during provisioning

## Error Handling

- Invalid usernames are reported but don't stop the provisioning process
- Failed organization/repository creations are logged and reported
- Detailed error messages in reports and logs
- Graceful handling of API rate limits and timeouts
